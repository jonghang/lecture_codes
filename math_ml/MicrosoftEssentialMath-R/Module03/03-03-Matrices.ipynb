Adding these will create a new matrix of the same dimensions with the values a<sub>1,1</sub> + b<sub>1,1</sub>, a<sub>1,2</sub> + b<sub>1,2</sub>, a<sub>1,3</sub> + b<sub>1,3</sub>,a<sub>2,1</sub> + b<sub>2,1</sub>, a<sub>2,2</sub> + b<sub>2,2</sub>, and a<sub>2,3</sub> + b<sub>2,3</sub>.

    "In the previous examples, we were able to add and subtract the matrices, because the *operands* (the matrices we are operating on) are ***conformable*** for the specific operation (in this case, addition or subtraction). To be conformable for addition and subtraction, the operands must have the same number of rows and columns. There are different conformability requirements for other operations, such as multiplication; which we'll explore later."
