Now look at the graphs of the parabolas we've worked with so far. Note that these parabolas both have a y-intercept; a point where the line intersects the y axis of the graph (in other words, when x is 0). However, note that the parabolas have *two* x-intercepts; in other words there are two points at which the line crosses the x axis (and y is 0). Additionally, imagine a downward opening parabola with its vertex at -1, -1. This is perfectly possible, and the line would never have an x value greater than -1, so it would have *no* x-intercepts.\n",

The implications of this are what make quadratic equations so interesting. When we solve the equation for ***x***, there are *two* correct answers.\n",

    "## Solving Quadratics Using the Completing the Square Method\n",
    "In quadratic equations where there is a *b* term; that is, a term containing **x** to the first power, it is impossible to directly calculate the square root. However, with some algebraic manipulation, you can take advantage of the ability to factor a polynomial expression in the form *a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>* as a binomial *perfect square* expression in the form *(a + b)<sup>2</sup>*.\n",

    "At first this might seem like some sort of mathematical sleight of hand, but follow through the steps careful and you'll see that there's nothing up my sleeve!\n",

    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x^{2} + 24x + 12^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be factored to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}(x + 12)^{2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so how does this help us solve a quadratic equation? Well, let's look at an example:\n",

    "Let's start as we've always done so far by restating the equation to solve ***x*** for a ***y*** value of 0:\n",

We can't take the square root of this, but we can turn it into a trinomial that will factor into a perfect square by adding a squared constant. The question is, what should that constant be? Well, we know that we're looking for an expression like *x<sup>2</sup> + 2**c**x + **c**<sup>2</sup>*, so our constant **c** is half of the coefficient we currently have for ***x***. This is **6**, making our constant **3**, which when squared is **9** So we can create a trinomial expression that will easily factor to a perfect square by adding 9; giving us the expression *x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 9*.\n",

    "## Shortcuts for Solving Quadratic Equations\n",
    "We've spent some time in this notebook discussing how to solve quadratic equations to determine the vertex of a parabola and the ***x*** values in relation to ***y***. It's important to understand the techniques we've used, which include:\n",
    "- Factoring\n",
    "- Calculating the Square Root\n",
    "- Completing the Square\n",
    "- Using the vertex form of the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying algebra for all of these techniques is the same, and this consistent algebra results in some shortcuts that you can memorize to make it easier to solve quadratic equations without going through all of the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating the Vertex from Standard Form\n",
    "You've already seen that converting a quadratic equation to the vertex form makes it easy to identify the vertex coordinates, as they're encoded as ***h*** and ***k*** in the equation itself - like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = a(x - \\textbf{h})^{2} + \\textbf{k}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you have an equation in standard form?:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = ax^{2} + bx + c\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a quick and easy technique you can apply to get the vertex coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To find ***h*** (which is the x-coordinate of the vertex), apply the following formula:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}h = \\frac{-b}{2a}\\end{equation}\n",
    "2. After you've found ***h***, use it in the quadratic equation to solve for ***k***:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\textbf{k} = a\\textbf{h}^{2} + b\\textbf{h} + c\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's the quadratic equation in standard form that we previously converted to the vertex form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = 2x^{2} - 16x + 2\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To find ***h***, we perform the following calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}h = \\frac{-b}{2a}\\;\\;\\;\\;=\\;\\;\\;\\;\\frac{-1 \\cdot - 16}{2\\cdot2}\\;\\;\\;\\;=\\;\\;\\;\\;\\frac{16}{4}\\;\\;\\;\\;=\\;\\;\\;\\;4\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we simply plug the value we've obtained for ***h*** into the quadratic equation in order to find ***k***:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}k = 2\\cdot(4^{2}) - 16\\cdot4 + 2\\;\\;\\;\\;=\\;\\;\\;\\;32 - 64 + 2\\;\\;\\;\\;=\\;\\;\\;\\;-30\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a vertex at 4,-30 is also what we previously calculated for the vertex form of the same equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = 2(x - 4)^{2} - 30\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Quadratic Formula\n",
    "Another useful formula to remember is the *quadratic formula*, which makes it easy to calculate values for ***x*** when ***y*** is **0**; or in other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply that formula to our equation, which you may remember looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}y = 2x^{2} - 16x + 2\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's plug the ***a***, ***b***, and ***c*** variables from our equation into the quadratic formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{--16 \\pm \\sqrt{-16^{2} - 4\\cdot2\\cdot2}}{2\\cdot2}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{16 \\pm \\sqrt{256 - 16}}{4}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This in turn (with the help of a calculator) simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{16 \\pm 15.491933384829668}{4}\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So our positive value for ***x*** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{16 + 15.491933384829668}{4}\\;\\;\\;\\;=7.872983346207417\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "And the negative value for ***x*** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}x = \\frac{16 - 15.491933384829668}{4}\\;\\;\\;\\;=0.12701665379258298\\end{equation}\n",
