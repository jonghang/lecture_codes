# QVM ===
# 
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 rigetti/qvm -S

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --name qvm rigetti/qvm -S

# QUILC ===== To run quilc in server mode, do the following:
# 
docker run --rm -it -p 5555:5555 rigetti/quilc -R

docker run --rm -it -p 5555:5555 --name quilc rigetti/quilc -R

# This will spawn an RPCQ-mode quilc server, that you can communicate
# with over TCP. If you would like to change the port of the server to
# PORT, you can alter the command as follows:
# 
docker run --rm -it -p PORT:PORT rigetti/quilc -R -p PORT

# Ports 5555 and 6000 are exposed using the EXPOSE directive in the
# rigetti/quilc image, so you can additionally use the -P option to
# automatically bind these container ports to randomly assigned host
# ports. You can then inspect the mapping using docker port CONTAINER
# [PORT].

Hi,

I downloaded the lecture Jupyter Notebooks to run in my local MacBook. I
managed to setup docker and run quilc and qvm on separate containers in my computer pulled from rigetti
repository.

These are the scripts I'm using to run the containers:

docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --name qvm rigetti/qvm -S

docker run --rm -it -p 5555:5555 --name quilc rigetti/quilc -R

How should I modify the following line of code to connect to the 2 containers:

qvm_server, quilc_server, fc = init_qvm_and_quilc('/usr/local/bin/qvm', '/usr/local/bin/quilc')

Thanks.
